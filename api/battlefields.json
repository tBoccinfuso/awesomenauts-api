While the Awesomenauts have been sent to the Starstorm to turn off its destructive gravitational collapse ray, and stop the system wide catastrophic event about to happen, the AI station has been equipped with an inferno device to stabilize the star and stop the space storm from forming.Unfortunately the station has had trouble harnessing the extreme stellar flares and sent out an emergency signal. The base structure is similar to other AI stations, but the explosive inferno device at the core of the station makes it a very perilous place.",
